It caters to almost all the age groups by providing the CDs, tapes of poems for kids, latest pop music collection for teenagers etc. Rhythm House also caters to a slightly older age group and boasts of the largest collection of regional and devotional music. Besides, if someone wants to pick up a good 60's or 70's rock album, chances are that he will get it here, and in case itâ€™s not available, they will order it within a week.

#### They have the largest tape collection one can find ranging from Motion Picture Soundtracks to Rock 'n Roll. Besides music, one can find a number of music related magazines on sale.
